A simple demo of gcov usage in different modes:

  * with `-fprofile-dir=XXX.%p` (`profdir.sh`)

Inspired by a family of questions like [With gcov, is it possible to merge to .gcda files?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3166198/with-gcov-is-it-possible-to-merge-to-gcda-files)

Needs [gcov-tool-many](https://github.com/yugr/maintainer-scripts/blob/master/gcov-tool-many) in PATH.
